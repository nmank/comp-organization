pointers:
	char *xp;
	*xp = 123;

	* means follow the pointer and change the value it is pointing at to 123.

	struct foo s;
	struct foo *sp;
	sp = &s; //what's the address in memory of this thing?
	s.field = 1.2;
	sp ->field = 1.7;
	(*sp).field = 1.7; //the same as ->

	float *fp = (float *) malloc( sizeof (float));
	*fp = 1.73;
	int *ip = (*int) fp;
	int i = *ip;

	what is i pointing to?
		the bit representation of the float 1.73

	(*(unsigned int *) (p))


void pointer is the return type of malloc:
	what is a void pointer?
